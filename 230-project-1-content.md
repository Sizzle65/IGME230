### **I. Concept**

---

---
### III. Platform

### IV. Story
FliP has a very simplistic theme, and not much of a story. The premise revolves around the player characters attempt to escape from the strange world he’s found himself in. As he finds himself capable of utilizing the weird power of this contrasting world, he struggles to find his way to home. However, as he makes his way through the world, voices and whispers appear randomly, twisted words that bring nothing but confusion and fear.

Due to this, the game is meant to invoke a combination of intrigue, fear and confusion for the player, as they make their way through the disturbing words and difficult puzzle platforms.

The players motivation resides in the desire to escape this twisted world, to be done with these crazy voices, and to overcome to difficult puzzle platforms that make up the core of the game. There will also be a non-story mode for just this purpose, an never-ending level based on a scoring system for high-score seekers.

### V. Esthetics
#### Style
The art style of the game is simplistic, mostly just black and white shapes making up the platforms, spikes and pitfalls, along with the occasional weird text of whatever color the background currently isn’t. This means if the background is white, the text is black, and vice versa. 
#### Sound
The sound will be ambient, eerie music played in a loop as the player goes through the level. The sound will increase in volume as you get closer to the end.
#### Effects
The sound effects will also include jumping and landing sounds, as well as death and victory sounds. The victory sounds will play when a level is completed, as well as when the player beats their previous high score in the endless mode.

### VI. Gameplay
#### Mechanics
The mechanics of FliP are straightforward, just like most of the game. The player can move the square that represents the main character left and right, as well as make him jump. In addition, the player can flip the color of the background and the player piece to change around the puzzle. This will be a core mechanic of the game, as it is required to proceed through many sections. 
#### Controls
The controls for movement are flexible, allowing the use of the arrows keys and/or WASD for side-to-side and jumping movements. When it comes to flipping the perspective, that will require hitting the spacebar.
The only need for the mouse will be in the main menu, when selecting your gamemode or viewing your highscores. 
#### Teaching
A tutorial mode will be included, using a small, simple level with notes on how to play the game, as well as the story behind it. 
#### Player Learning
Due to the simplistic nature of the game and it’s controls, player learning will be fairly straightforward. As the player progresses through the levels, they will quickly gain the ability to utilize the limited controls, and accomplish things like rapidly changing perspectives while racing past the obstacles. It will likely require a decent amount of trial and error to get to this point, but that’s part of the difficulty of the game.
